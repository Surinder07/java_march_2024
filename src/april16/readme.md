## Recap 

Arrays 
Collection of similar data type 

types 
1. Single dim.
2. multi dim. 


Strings

Immutable ? why? 

Heap ---> String constant pool 

String obj ------> Heap (non SCP )

String vs StringBuffer Vs StringBuilder  

Mutable strings 
1. StringBuffer
2. StringBuilder

StringBuffer [1.0]                               StringBuilder 
1. Mutable                                  Mutable
2. Thread Safe (synchronized)               non thread safe (non - synchronized)


thread safe - not allow multithreading 

ATM ----> 

thread -- a small process.



========================
Object Oriented Paradigm [OOPs]
========================


functional programming --- functions are first class citizen. 


OOP -- object are first class citizen


Objects 
Classes 

4 pillars of OOP.
1. Inheritance
==================
iphone 10 -- Face id , camera , 
iphone 15  -- face id, enchaced camera, dynamic island.

one class inherits from the other class
properties and behaviour



A   variables, methods etc...
|
B   inherit from A class.

A    ----> Parent class/ Super class / Base class
|
B   -----> Child Class / Derived class/ Sub class


2. Encapsulation
====================
Data hiding, wrapping up the data in single unit.


3. Polymorphism - many forms. 

method overloading....
method overriding....

method overloading vs overriding.

sum(int a)
sum (int a, int b)

4. Abstraction

Abstract ?
showing only essential features but internal details/complexity. 


encapsulation                            abstraction
hiding everything                        showing neccessary details

===========================
Access Modifiers
===========================

1. private --- accessed within the class only   // your wifi.
2. public  --- access anywhere.     // starbucks wifi
3. protected -- after inheritance      
4. default   --   no keyword






====================
Object 
==================
every class in Java has a super class called as Object 
You created it or 
created by Java
