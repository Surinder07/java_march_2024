what an object does rather than how it does? 

Iphone ---- internal working of iphone 
Car ----- we know how to drive , how engine works

1. abstract class  [0- 100 %]
2. Interfaces [100 %] -  < Java 7   

Java 8 and above -- interfaces have changed.

1. class has to declared with abstract keyword
2. if there is one or more abstract method in the class, class needs to be declared abstract.
3. You can not create an object of abstract class
