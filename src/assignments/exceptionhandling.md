## InvalidAgeException 

Implement a Java program that prompts users to enter their age for the driving license test.
Validate the user input to ensure that the age provided is within the acceptable range for taking the test (e.g., between 18 and 100 years old).
If the age provided by the user is valid, display a message indicating that they are eligible to take the driving test.
If the age provided by the user is invalid (outside the acceptable range), throw a custom exception named InvalidAgeException.
Handle the InvalidAgeException by displaying an appropriate error message to the user, informing them that their age is invalid for the driving test application.
