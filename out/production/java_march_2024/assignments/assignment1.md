## Assignment 
1. Create a program that takes a character as input and determines if it's a vowel or a consonant.
2. Write a program that simulates a traffic light. 
The user can input a color (red, yellow, or green), and the program should output the action based on the traffic light color (stop, prepare to stop, go).
3. You are tasked with developing a Java program that checks a student's grade based on their score. The grading system is as follows:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
E: 0-59 (Fail)
Write a Java program that takes the student's score as input and 
determines and displays the corresponding grade based on the above criteria. 
Ensure that the program handles invalid input gracefully and provides 
appropriate feedback.
