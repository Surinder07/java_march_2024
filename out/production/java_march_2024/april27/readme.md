## Recap 

1. Polymorphism 
method overloading vs method overriding 

2. abstract class  (0-100%) 

[Java 7 or below]
Interfaces  (100 %) 

its a contract which  or any class  inherits from has to fulfill that contract 
provide the implementation.



public interface Furniture {
// by default fields are  public static final
int x = 10;
// by default public abstract
void show();


}




why do we need interfaces?

Mobile m = new Mobile();

1. Build in packages - Java
